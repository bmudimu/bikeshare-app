# Project Title

US Bikeshare Data Analysis with **Python, FLASK and React**
![app screenshot](screenshots/bikeshare-app.png)

## Getting Started
I thought I could create a web app instead of the basic CLI user prompts that
would have fulfilled the requirements of the bikeshare project. The web app was
bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and provides a GUI for users to query the Data and get some basic statistics from
the backend flask API.

machine for development and testing purposes.
