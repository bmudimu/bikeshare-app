# Project Title

Programming for Data Science Project 2: US Bikeshare Data Analysis Project
[Python] + [FLASK] Backend and [React.js] Frontend

## Getting Started
I thought I could create a web app instead of the basic CLI user prompts that
would have fulfilled the requirements of the bikeshare project. The web app was
bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and provides a GUI for users to query the Data and get some basic statistics from
the backend flask API.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

Clone the repo from https://github.com/bmudimu/bikeshare-app.git and cd into the
client folder.

##Available Scripts

### 'npm install'
